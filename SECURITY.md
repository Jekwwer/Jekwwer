# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the `jekwwer/jekwwer` repository
and provides instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

As this repository does not host a software application, version-specific support is not applicable.
However, all assets and scripts within this repository are actively monitored, and any identified vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in this repository:

1. Please email directly at [report@jekwwer.com][report@jekwwer.com] with the following details:

   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Affected versions, if applicable.
   - Any potential fixes or workarounds you may suggest.

2. Alternatively, you can open a private security advisory on GitHub:
   - Navigate to the repository's [Security Advisories][security-advisories].
   - Click on **Create security advisory** and follow the instructions.

I aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **72** hours
and provide a resolution or update within **14** days.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for showcasing a GitHub profile page. While it contains minimal code or assets that could pose security risks, I still encourage responsible disclosure of any identified issues to maintain the integrity and safety of the repository.
