# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

I pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

I am committed to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy
project environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and learning from any mistakes made
- Focusing on what is best for the project as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassment of any kind, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the sole maintainer, I am responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate action
in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

I reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned with this Code of Conduct. Where appropriate, I will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing
the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
at [report@jekwwer.com][report@jekwwer.com].
All complaints will be reviewed and addressed promptly and fairly, respecting the privacy and security of the reporter.

Code of Conduct:

and why it was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
